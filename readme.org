[[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Greenplumlogotype.jpg]]

Greenplum is the most advanced MPP big data platform. This repo list the compatible open source utilities and extensions.

Why another repo? The [[https://github.com/kongyew/awesome-greenplum][old one]] is on longer maintained and out-of-date.

This repo focus on open source and community tools. No commercial, no ads. Feel free to create issues and PRs if you think there is anything missing.
